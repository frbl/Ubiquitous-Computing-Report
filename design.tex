\label{cha:design}
Now that the problems are clear, it is time to present the system that should solve these problems: the SnoozZz system. This chapter describes the design of the system. This chapter is divided in to three parts: the requirements for the system are listed in the first part; the components, that make up the system, and their responsibilities are listed second; lastly, an overview of the components and how these work together is provided.

\section{Components} % (fold)
\label{sec:components}

\subsection{Sensor} % (fold)
\label{sub:sensor}
- assuming some processing capabilities
- detection of state is done elsewhere for now, subject to change
% subsection sensor (end)

\subsection{Data Processing} % (fold)
\label{sub:data_processing}
- assuming this is best done on a separate device (server)
- not sure about the amount of processing required
- want to be flexible, divided between sensor device and other device, could eliminate other device if needed
% subsection data_processing (end)

\subsection{Communication} % (fold)
\label{sub:communication}
- getting information from sensor to data-processing (data processing may be possible on the `sensor')
- communicating the sleep state to other devices
% subsection communication (end)

% section components (end)

\section{Overview} % (fold)
\label{sec:overview}
- Diagram with components and lines of communication
- Describe what is should be done and in what order
