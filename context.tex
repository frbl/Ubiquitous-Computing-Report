\label{cha:context}
In order to see what ubiquitous computing can do for people while they sleep, there must at least be a basic understanding of what sleep is. Sleeping consists of several states ~\cite{Silber:2007fk}, these states are described in the first section. What a system can do for people also depends on the ability to detect what sleep state people are in. In the second section of this chapter, two ways of detecting sleep state are described.
 
\section{Sleep States} % (fold)
\label{sec:sleep_states}
There are two broad sleep states: REM (Rapid eye movement) and NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. Sleeping people go from REM to NREM sleep in cycles. The two main states are described first, followed by what the cycle looks like.

\subsection{REM Sleep} % (fold)
\label{sub:rem_sleep}
Rapid eye movement sleep is characterized by, unsurprisingly, by rapid movements of the eyes. There are two other important characteristics: the first characteristic is that other muscles are in a state of paralysis, meaning that people do not move anything besides their eyes during this state; the second characteristic is that there seems to be a lot of brain activity during this stage.

Dreaming usually occurs during this sleep state. This could explain why the eyes move rapidly, according to Leclair-Visonneau, et \emph{al} ~\cite{LeclairVisonneau:2010:Brain:20478849} the eyes seem to move as if the dream is real. Dreaming can also explain why muscles are paralyzed during REM sleep, this would prevent people from accidentally hurting themselves by acting out their dreams.

The function of REM sleep is up to debate, some studies suggest that REM sleep improves memory ~\cite{Marshall:2006:Nature:17086200} or creativeness ~\cite{Wagner:2004:Nature:14737168}. People wake up easily during REM sleep; i.e., it is a light sleep state. However, because its function is not very clear, it may be preferable to not interrupt it intentionally.

\subsection{NREM Sleep} % (fold)
\label{sub:non_rem_sleep}
Non-rapid eye movement sleep can be further divided into three states: \emph{N1}, \emph{N2} and \emph{N3}. The first two state can be characterized as light sleep and the third as deep sleep. This means that people are easily awakened during the first two stages. There are some other characteristics worth mentioning.

The first state, \emph{N1}, is what people are in when they fall asleep. When woken up during this state, just after falling asleep, people may not even be aware that they have been asleep. This state, however, does not only occur just after falling asleep, an overview of the cycle of states is provided in the next section.
