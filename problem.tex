\label{cha:problem}
In order to take sleep into account in an ubiquitous computing system, it is necessary to detect a persons' sleep state; this should happen in an unobtrusive manner. Sleep state detection by measuring movement using an accelerometer would enable this; but how can this be accomplished. This problem can be divided into four parts, which will be described in this chapter.

\section{Collecting Data} % (fold)
\label{sec:collecting_data}
For the collection of data from a person sleeping, multiple techniques can be used. However, it is often deemed unwanted to be disturbed while sleeping. Therefore the collection of data should be done in a for the user ubiquitous way, so the technique is not seen as a burden.

\section{Measuring Movement} % (fold)
\label{sec:measuring_movement}
There exist different methods for measuring which sleep state a person a person is in, for example, with an \emph{EEG} ~\cite{Itil196976} or using an accelerometer. For this project using an EEG was not an option. In this project the detection is done by measuring the amount of movement a person has overnight. In order to measure the movement a sensor is needed. As described this sensor should be non intrusive and be able to capture the movement of a person. To measure this an accelerometer is used. A mobile phone was used to do these measurements, as a lot of the modern phones have accelerometers able to do these measurements and have the ability to connect to another device.

\section{From Movement to Sleep State} % (fold)
\label{sec:translate_movement_patterns_to_sleep_states}
Capturing movement is not the only problem; when it is possible to capture movement while a user sleeps, this movement is not yet a sleep state. The measurements have to be classified in some way, to determine in which sleep state the user is in. As described by Hoque et \emph{al}. ~\cite{Hoque:2010:MBP:1921081.1921088} it is possible to distinguish the different sleep states based on the movement a person makes while sleeping. This project provides a way to do this.

\section{Communication of Information} % (fold)
\label{sec:communicating_relevant_information}
For doing the translation from movements to sleep state, a classification has to be done on these measurements. For this, calculations have to be done. As it is possible that the sensor has not enough processing power to do this or the calculations have to be used elsewhere, something more than just the sensor is needed. These measurements have to be communicated to an external device, capable of doing this.
