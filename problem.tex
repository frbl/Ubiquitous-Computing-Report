In order to take sleep into account in an ubiquitous computing system, it is necessary to detect a persons' sleep state; this should happen in an unobtrusive manner. Sleep state detection by measuring movement using an accelerometer would enable this; but how can this be accomplished. This problem can be divided into four parts, which will be described in this chapter.
